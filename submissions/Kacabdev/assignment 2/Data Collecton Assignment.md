## 1. Title & Collection Method

**Dataset:** User satisfaction and recommendation behavior for E-Wallet services used in Jijiga, Ethiopia.

The dataset focuses on understanding how users perceive different digital financial service platforms such as Telebirr, CBE Birr, E-Birr/Kaafi, and other mobile payment applications. The goal is to identify the factors that influence whether a user recommends an E-Wallet service to others.

Since no publicly available dataset exists that captures local user experiences with these platforms in Jijiga, the data was collected directly through a survey.

### How I Collected the Data

* **Google Forms:** Designed and distributed a structured questionnaire.
* **Social Media Distribution:** Shared the survey through WhatsApp and Telegram groups.
* **Direct Responses:** Collected responses from local users of digital payment services.
* **Manual Verification:** Checked responses for completeness and consistency before cleaning.

Final Dataset Size:

* **Rows:** 50
* **Columns:** 7

|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| App_Category | Categorical | Type of E-Wallet application used | Feature X |
| Frequency_of_Use | Numeric | Number of times the service is used | Feature X |
| Ease_of_Use | Numeric | User rating (1–5) for usability | Feature X |
| Trans_Speed | Numeric | User rating (1–5) for transaction speed | Feature X |
| Net_Dependency | Numeric | User rating (1–5) for network dependence | Feature X |
| Service_Charges | Numeric | User rating (1–5) for service affordability | Feature X |
| Recommendation | Binary | Whether the user recommends the service (0 = No, 1 = Yes) | Label y |

## Target Variable

`Recommendation`

The machine learning objective is to predict whether a user is likely to recommend an E-Wallet service based on their experience.

## Notes

The dataset was collected from users of E-Wallet services in Jijiga, Ethiopia. Because the dataset contains only 50 observations, the results should be interpreted as exploratory rather than representative of all users in Ethiopia.
